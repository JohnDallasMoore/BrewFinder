# BrewFinder

## Description
This web app is designed to help users find breweries in a particular city.  The app uses the Open Brewery Database API to fetch brewery data and the Google Maps API to display brewery markers on a map.  Users can also have an option to view "Our Suggestions" which provides more details about selected breweries, such as their name, address, phone number, and website link.  Users can also get directions to a particular brewery from their current location using the Google Maps API. With BrewFinder, users can plan their brewery visits accordingly and enjoy exploring local breweries in their chosen city.
